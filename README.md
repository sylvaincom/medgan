# Some additional works on Edward Choi's medGAN

In this repository, I share my own work that is based on [Edward Choi](https://github.com/mp2893/)'s [medGAN](https://github.com/mp2893/medgan). Congrats to Edward's excellent work!

medGAN (for medical GAN) is a generative adversarial network (GAN) for electronic health records (EHR). medGAN implements the algorithm introduced in the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06490):

I opened a few pull requests on Edward Choi's medGAN repository:
* [Fixing an error due to version 1.16.3 of NumPy](https://github.com/mp2893/medgan/pull/15): merged and closed (following this [issue](https://github.com/mp2893/medgan/issues/14) I opened).
* [Fixing an error when running step 2-3 with count variables](https://github.com/mp2893/medgan/pull/17): merged and closed.

- _Author_: Sylvain Combettes
- _Dates_: June 24th – Sept. 13th, 2019 (3 months)
- _Context_: As part of my penultimate-year at Mines Nancy, I did a 3-month research internship at [Servier](https://servier.com/en/), the second largest pharmaceutical company in France. In 2018, Servier had a €4.2 billion turnover, operated in 149 countries and had more than 22,000 employees.
- _Topic_: Generating fictitious realistic patient data in order to boost the prediction score [synthesis, dataset augmentation].
- _Method_: Combining GANs (generative adversarial networks) with autoencoders [implicit density estimation].
- _Programming_: Python.
- _Result_: The prediction score can be increased by more than 5% on binary values.

## Abstract

In the first chapter, we do a general presentation on **GANs**, in particular how they work. GANs are a revolutionary generative model invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. The key idea behind GANs is to have two neural networks competing against each other: the generator and the discriminator. GANs can synthesize samples that are impressively realistic.

In the second chapter, we apply GANs to patient data. The method is called **medGAN** (for medical GAN) and was developed by Edward Choi in 2018. medGAN can only synthesize binary or count values. There are two main applications of medGAN: privacy and dataset augmentation. We only focus on dataset augmentation from a real-life dataset: we generate fictitious yet realistic samples that can then be concatenated with the real-life dataset into an augmented dataset (that has more samples). Training a predictive model on the augmented dataset rather than on the real-life dataset can boost the prediction score (if the generated data is realistic enough).

## How to use this repository

* `01_tips-for-medgan.md`: [Additional explanations on how to run Edward Choi's medGAN](https://github.com/sylvaincom/medgan-tips/blob/master/01_tips-for-medgan.md). In this markdown, I add explanations that complete Edward Choi's `README.md` of his medGAN repository.
* `02_how-medgan-binary-works.ipynb`: [Understanding how medGAN works on the MIMIC-III dataset of shape (46 520, 1 071) with binary values](https://github.com/sylvaincom/medgan-tips/blob/master/02_how-medgan-binary-works.ipynb). In this notebook, I provide code cells and explanations to help better understand and run medGAN (on binary values). I also measure the accuracy of the fake generated dataset comparing to the real-life original one.
* `03_how-medgan-count-works.ipynb`: [Understanding how medGAN works (with count features)](https://github.com/sylvaincom/medgan-tips/blob/master/03_how-medgan-count-works.ipynb). In this notebook, I provide code cells and explanations that can help better understand and run medGAN on count features.
* `04_accuracy-medgan-binary-small.ipynb`: [Using medGAN on the MIMIC-III dataset of shape (1000, 100) with binary values](https://github.com/sylvaincom/medgan-tips/blob/master/04_accuracy-medgan-binary-small.ipynb). This is shorter version of `02_how-medgan-binary-works.ipynb`: we only sample from a dataset of shape (1000, 100) instead of (46520, 1071) and check the accuracy.
* `05_prediction-augmentation.ipynb`: [Using medGAN to boost the prediction score with data augmentation on the MIMIC-III dataset of shape (1000, 100) with binary values](https://github.com/sylvaincom/medgan-tips/blob/master/05_prediction-augmentation.ipynb). In this notebook, I use `medGAN` to perform data augmentation, thus to boost prediction performance. Spoiler: it works (under some conditions).
